<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a Master student from <a href='https://www.ime.tsinghua.edu.cn/'> School of Integrated Circuits</a>, <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/'> Tsinghua University</a>. My research interest includes memristor-based in-memory computing, brain-computer interface, and compressed sensing.

I'm very fortunate to be supervised by <a href='https://www.ime.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1015/1798.htm'> Prof. Jianshi Tang</a> and <a href='http://stor.ime.tsinghua.edu.cn/'> LEMON Lab</a> since May 2023. 

Before that I had been supervised by <a href='https://hongchen.ime.tsinghua.edu.cn/'> Prof. Hong Chen</a> for 1 year.

Hobbies: <a href='https://h5mota.com/user/?id=34795#/score'>magic tower</a>, cricket, <a href='https://www.dota2.com/home'>Defense of the Ancients 2</a>
